Gaslight sort is a sorting algorithm with constant space and time complexity. How does it achieve such levels of genius? Simple! Stop asking questions and just accept the results, trust that the brilliant contributors have handled it (imagine it's another layer of abstraction!)

If you would like to contribute to Gaslight-Sort, please clone the repo, create a branch, git add ., git commit -m "Your message here", and make a pull request. 

Don't forget to clean before pushing! (Because I'm too lazy to create a .gitignore lmao)
